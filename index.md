## Welcome to the Open Privacy Inititative

The Open Privacy Initiative is an ongoing effort to protect the human right of privacy in the digital age. In recent times, companies have gone beyond their right to track, identify, and gather informaton on their users. This has gone to the point where just visiting a website can result in giving the owner of that website information about your entire life.
**This needs to stop.**
We aim to do two things:
- protect peopleâ€™s privacy online
- keep the web open and accessible to everyone

Big companies have gone too far in infringing on people's privacy and the people just go with it. Help us make the web a better place.

### The Story

The Open Privacy Inititative was created in late 2021 after it's founder requested their personal data from a company - and was surprised of what it contained.

Not only did the report include expected information, like:
- logs of service usage
- IP address
- email

It also contained personal information which was *never given to the company*, such as:
- full name (never provided)
- accurate address (never provided)

Additionally, the founder noticed that the application was always using the microphone and was always listening.

After finding all of this out, they commited to starting a foundation to solve this issue. 
Thus, the OPI was born.
Together, we can protect the given rights of the people and make the web a better and more open place.
